Local Variables when we are using in Lambda Exxpression
        almost similar to Final variable(Effectively)

Advantages of Effectively Final:
    1. Easy to perform concurrency operations.
    2. Promotes Functional Programming and demotes the
       imperative style programming.

Introduction to Stream API:
    1. To perform some operations on Collections.
    2. parallel operations are easy to perform with Stream API
        without having a spawn multiple threads.

Stream?
    - Sequence of elements which can be created out of a collections
       such as List or any kind of I/O Resource.
            using Keyword: 1. stream()  2. parallelStream()

    - collect(Collectors.toList), very important to convert stream to List.

How Stream API Work?
    - It work in a sequential manner not like after completion of stream pf all students
        to filter then to output

Stream Operations are 2 types: (Stream Pipeline)
    1. Terminal Operations
    2. Intermediate Operations

without Terminal Operations the executions doesnt start.
examples of terminal operations are collect, foreach etc.

examples of Intermediate Operations are stream, filter etc.

For Debugging a Stream
1. peek can be used which takes consumer as an input.

Stream API:
1. map()
    - used for only to change data, takes function lambda expression
2. flatMap()
    - converts one type to another as like map() method.
    - used in the context of Stream where each element in the stream
        represents multiple elements.
            example :
                1. each stream element represents
                    1.1 Stream<> List
                    1.2 Stream<> Array
3. distinct() - Returns a Stream with unique Elements
4. count() - Returns a long with the total number of elements in the Stream
5. sorted() - Sort the elements in the Stream.
6. reduce() - Terminal Operation. Used to Reduce the contents of a stream to
    a Single Value.
    Takes 2 Parameters as a input.
    1. First Parameters - default or Initial Value.
    2. Second Parameters - Binary Operator<>
7. limit(n) - limits the "n" number of elements to be processed in the stream.
8. skip(n) - skips the "n" number of elements from the stream.
9. anyMatch() - Returns true if any one of the element matches thr predicate,
    otherwise false.
10. allMatch() - Returns true if all the elements in the stream matches the
    predicate, otherwise false.
11. noneMatch() - just opposite to allMatch(). Return true if none of the element
    in the stream matches the predicate, otherwise false.
12. findFirst(), findAny() - Used to find an element in the stream.
        Both the Functions return the result of type Optional.
        Main difference between anyMatch, allMatch and these are they return boolean
        this functions return Optional<Integer>.


Factory Stream() Methods:
1. Of() - Creates a stream of certain value passed to this method.
    Example : Stream<String> stringStrea = Stream.of("Adam","dan","Julie");
2. Iterate(), generate() - Used to create infinite Streams.
    Example : iterate(1, x -> x*2);
              Stream.generate(<Supplier>)

Numeric Streams:
    - Represents the primitive value in a Stream.
        - IntStream
        - LongStream
        - DoubleStream

IntStream:
    - IntStream.range(1,50)
    - IntStream.rangeClosed(1,50)

same with LongStream but not in the case of DoubleStream.
DoubleStream:
    IntStream.rangeClose(1,100).asDoubleStream.forEach(System.out::println)

Numeric Stream - Aggregate Functions
    - sum()
    - max()
    - min()
    - average()
